## Libft - 42

# Description:
Libft is a foundational C project that involves recreating essential functions from the C standard library from scratch. This project serves as an introduction to low-level programming concepts/functions that will be reused throughout the curriculum. These functions include string manipulations, memory manipulations, operations on linked lists, etc.

# Context:
Part of 42 Common Core.

# Main Technologies / Skills Used:

- **Programming Languages: C**
- **Memory Management:** Dynamic allocation, pointer manipulation, avoiding memory leaks (ft_memset, ft_bzero, ft_memcpy, etc.)
- **String Manipulation:** Character arrays, string parsing, concatenation, trimming  (ft_strlen, ft_strcpy, ft_strcat, etc.)
- **Linked Lists:** (ft_lstnew, ft_lstadd_front, ft_lstsize, etc.)
- **Type Conversion:** (ft_atoi, ft_itoa, etc.)
- **Math Operations:** (ft_abs, ft_pow, etc.)
- **System Programming:** File descriptors, low-level I/O operations (ft_putchar_fd, ft_putstr_fd, ft_putendl_fd etc.)
